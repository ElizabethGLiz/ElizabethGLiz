### Hello, Welcome all!👋
I am a dedicated student👩‍🎓 whose journey has been defined by love, resilience, and a commitment to learning. For over two decades, I devoted myself to caring for my special needs son, embodying the true essence of a caregiver. My unwavering dedication and boundless love have been the cornerstone of my family's strength and unity.

Twenty-one years ago, I embarked on a professional journey as a system analyst, where I honed my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. My keen eye for detail and knack for deciphering complex systems made me a valuable asset in the technology industry.

Despite the demands of my career, I prioritized my son's well-being above all else, navigating the challenges of caregiving with grace and fortitude. My role as a caregiver not only required patience and empathy but also instilled in me a profound sense of purpose and compassion.

Now, as I embark on a new chapter in my life, I successfully pursued a course🎓 in Data Analysis at CODE:YOU. Driven by my innate curiosity and passion for learning, I am eager to explore the vast realm of data analytics and unlock new opportunities for personal and professional growth.
